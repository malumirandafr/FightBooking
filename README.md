The Java code presented is a program that simulates the reservation of seats on flights. It allows you to check the availability of seats, make reservations, cancel reservations, check the occupancy rate of flights and view passengers on each flight. The program uses classes such as Passenger and Flight, as well as lists to store passenger data and reservations. It also handles exceptions to avoid conflicts such as occupied seats or duplicate CPFs (the Tax ID issued once you have been registered with the Brazilian Revenue). In summary, the code simulates the process of booking flights, providing basic functionality to manage reservations and available seats.
